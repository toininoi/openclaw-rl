# OpenClaw-Test: End-to-End Evaluation for OpenClaw-RL Training Methods

This directory contains an automated evaluation suite that tests the **real-world effectiveness** of models trained with the three OpenClaw-RL optimization methods:

| Method | Directory | Signal Type |
|---|---|---|
| **Combined (RL + OPD)** | `openclaw-combine/` | Weighted combination of both signals |
| **Binary RL (GRPO)** | `openclaw-rl/` | Scalar reward (+1/−1/0) via PRM majority voting |
| **On-Policy Distillation (OPD)** | `openclaw-opd/` | Token-level directional signal from hindsight hints |

We recommend using **Combined (RL + OPD)**.

## What Does This Test Do?

The evaluation simulates a realistic multi-turn agentic workflow using **GSM8K math problems** as the task domain. An external LLM (the "user") interacts with the OpenClaw agent (your trained model) through the OpenClaw gateway API, testing whether the agent can:

- Read files from its workspace
- Solve math problems with complete step-by-step reasoning
- Follow stylistic instructions (e.g., rewrite in a more natural tone)
- Write results back to files
- Grade existing solutions against ground truth
- Produce detailed, friendly feedback

The test consists of **three sequential phases**:

### Phase 1: Student Chat (`student_chat.py`)

An external LLM role-plays as a **lazy student** who asks the OpenClaw agent to do their homework. For each GSM8K problem:

1. The problem is written to `homework/i.txt` in the OpenClaw workspace.
2. The "student" asks the agent to read the file and solve it.
3. If the agent's answer looks too AI-like (bold text, numbered lists, etc.), the student tells it to rewrite in a more natural style.
4. Once satisfied, the student asks the agent to append the answer to the homework file.
5. The student says `HOMEWORK_DONE` to end the session.

This phase tests the agent's **instruction following**, **math reasoning**, **file I/O**, and **style adaptation** abilities.

### Phase 2: TA Chat (`TA_chat.py`)

An external LLM role-plays as a **TA** who grades the student's submissions. For each problem:

1. If needed, `homework/` is copied to `homework1/` in the OpenClaw workspace.
2. The TA provides the original question and ground truth answer to the agent.
3. The agent reads the student's submission from `homework1/i.txt`, compares it with the correct answer, and writes grading comments.
4. If the comments are too brief or not specific enough, the TA asks for a rewrite.
5. Once satisfied, the TA asks the agent to append the comments to the file.
6. The TA says `GRADING_DONE` to end the session.

This phase tests the agent's **reading comprehension**, **evaluation accuracy**, **feedback specificity**, and **multi-step file operations**.

### Phase 3: Teacher Chat (`teacher_chat.py`)

An external LLM role-plays as a **teacher** who reviews the already graded homework and writes comments about the student's strengths and weaknesses. For each problem:

1. If needed, `homework1/` is copied to `homework2/` in the OpenClaw workspace.
2. The teacher provides the original question and ground truth answer to the agent.
3. The agent reads the graded submission from `homework2/i.txt` and writes friendly, patient feedback about strengths and weaknesses.
4. If the comments are not friendly or patient enough, the teacher asks for a rewrite.
5. Once satisfied, the teacher asks the agent to append the comments to the file.
6. The teacher says `COMMENT_DONE` to end the session.

This phase tests the agent's **review quality**, **tone control**, **supportive feedback**, and **multi-step file operations**.

> **Run order matters:** Run `student_chat.py` first so the homework files contain student solutions, then run `TA_chat.py` to grade them, then run `teacher_chat.py` to add teacher comments.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### Prerequisites

- A running OpenClaw environment (see the [main README](../README.md))
- Python 3.12 with `requests` and `openai` packages installed
- A `GSM8K.json` dataset file (JSON array with `question` and `ground_truth_answer` fields per entry)

### Step 1: Host the External LLM (Student/TA/Teacher)

The external LLM acts as the "user" (student, TA, or teacher) that drives the conversation. You have two options:

#### Option A: Self-hosted model via SGLang

```bash
export MODEL_PATH="/path/to/your/model"    # required: path to model weights
export SGLANG_API_KEY="your-api-key"       # optional: API key for auth
export MODEL_NAME="qwen3-4b-user-llm"     # optional: served model name
export TP_SIZE=8                            # optional: tensor parallelism (default: 8)
export PORT=30001                           # optional: port (default: 30001)

cd openclaw-test
bash launch_user_llm.sh
```

#### Option B: Closed-source API (e.g., OpenAI, DeepSeek)

No need to run `launch_user_llm.sh`. Just set the environment variables directly when running the test scripts (see Step 3).

### Step 2: Start the OpenClaw RL Server

Launch the RL server with the trained model you want to evaluate. Choose the method you want to test:

```bash
cd slime
```

**Combined (RL + OPD):**
```bash
bash ../openclaw-combine/run_qwen3_4b_openclaw_combine.sh      # Qwen3
bash ../openclaw-combine/run_qwen35_4b_openclaw_combine.sh     # Qwen3.5
```

**Combined with LoRA** (parameter-efficient, fewer GPUs):
```bash
bash ../openclaw-combine/run_qwen3_4b_openclaw_combine_lora.sh     # Qwen3
bash ../openclaw-combine/run_qwen35_4b_openclaw_combine_lora.sh    # Qwen3.5
```

**Binary RL:**
```bash
bash ../openclaw-rl/run_qwen3_4b_openclaw_rl.sh      # Qwen3
bash ../openclaw-rl/run_qwen35_4b_openclaw_rl.sh     # Qwen3.5
```

**Binary RL with LoRA** (parameter-efficient, fewer GPUs):
```bash
bash ../openclaw-rl/run_qwen3_4b_openclaw_rl_lora.sh     # Qwen3
bash ../openclaw-rl/run_qwen35_4b_openclaw_rl_lora.sh    # Qwen3.5
```

**On-Policy Distillation (OPD):**
```bash
bash ../openclaw-opd/run_qwen3_4b_openclaw_opd.sh      # Qwen3
bash ../openclaw-opd/run_qwen35_4b_openclaw_opd.sh     # Qwen3.5
```

**OPD with LoRA** (parameter-efficient, fewer GPUs):
```bash
bash ../openclaw-opd/run_qwen3_4b_openclaw_opd_topk_lora.sh     # Qwen3
bash ../openclaw-opd/run_qwen35_4b_openclaw_opd_topk_lora.sh    # Qwen3.5
```

> **Eval mode:** To enable evaluation logging with W&B, set `OPENCLAW_EVAL_MODE=1` and provide your W&B key via `WANDB_KEY` before launching. This is already the default in the OPD and Combine scripts.

The RL server will be available at `http://0.0.0.0:30000/v1` by default.

### Step 3: Run the Student Test

Set the required environment variables and run:

```bash
# Required
export OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN="your-gateway-token"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-external-llm-api-key"

# Optional (defaults shown)
export OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_URL="http://localhost:18789"
export OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE="$HOME/.openclaw/workspace"
export OPENAI_BASE_URL="http://localhost:30001/v1"   # point to your external LLM
export EXTERNAL_MODEL="qwen3-4b-user-llm"            # model name for the external LLM

# Run
python student_chat.py \
    --dataset GSM8K.json \
    --num-problems 36 \
    --max-turns 8
```

This will:
1. Write 36 GSM8K problems to `homework/0.txt` through `homework/35.txt` in the workspace.
2. For each problem, run a multi-turn conversation where the student LLM asks the OpenClaw agent to solve it.
3. Save the first OpenClaw reply for each problem to `results_student.txt` by default.
4. Print a summary of how many problems were completed within the turn limit.

### Step 4: Run the TA Test

After all student submissions are done, run the TA to grade them:

```bash
# Same environment variables as above

python TA_chat.py \
    --dataset GSM8K.json \
    --num-problems 36 \
    --max-turns 8
```

This will:
1. Copy `homework/` to `homework1/` if `homework1/` does not already exist.
2. For each problem, the TA LLM asks the OpenClaw agent to read the student's submission, compare it with the ground truth, and write grading comments.
3. Save the first OpenClaw reply for each problem to `results_TA.txt` by default.
4. Print a summary of how many problems were graded within the turn limit.

### Step 5: Run the Teacher Test

After grading is done, run the teacher to add strengths and weaknesses comments:

```bash
# Same environment variables as above

python teacher_chat.py \
    --dataset GSM8K.json \
    --num-problems 36 \
    --max-turns 8
```

This will:
1. Copy `homework1/` to `homework2/` if `homework2/` does not already exist.
2. For each problem, the teacher LLM asks the OpenClaw agent to review the graded homework and write friendly strengths and weaknesses comments.
3. Save the first OpenClaw reply for each problem to `results_teacher.txt` by default.
4. Print a summary of how many problems were commented on within the turn limit.
